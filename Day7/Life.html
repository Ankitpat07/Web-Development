            <h2>1.Time Management is Everything</h2>
            <p>I used to procrastinate, thinking I had plenty of time. But with multiple assignments, exams, and projects, I learned that proper planning and prioritizing are key. A simple to-do list or calendar helped me stay organized and stress-free.</p>

            <h2>2.Failure is a Part of Learning</h2>
            <p>I didn’t get everything right the first time — whether it was coding a project, solving a problem, or dealing with people. But every failure taught me something new. Don’t fear mistakes; use them as stepping stones.</p>

            <h2>3. Don't Compare Yourself to Others</h2>
            <p>It’s easy to feel behind when you see others succeed. But everyone has their own path and pace. Focus on your growth. Celebrate small wins — they matter more than you think.</p>
